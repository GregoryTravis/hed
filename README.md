Hed; a text editor in Haskell
======
Just another I'm-learning-haskell project.

In this project I
* used curses
* learned how to use monoids
* made a monad stack

It's not much of an editor, since all you can do to text is insert a 'z' and delete character.  It does, however, run the Game Of Life.
